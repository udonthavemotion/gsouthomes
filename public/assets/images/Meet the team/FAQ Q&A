FAQs
Gulf South Homes Inc
Have a question about our homes and modular homes? We have the answer. Check out these FAQs and give us a call today for more information!

Do you carry repo houses?
We occasionally have pre-owned or repo homes available. Inventory changes quickly, so we recommend giving us a call or stopping by to ask about current availability. If you’re looking for a great deal, we’ll help you explore all the options.

Do you have modulars?
Yes, we offer modular homes through trusted builders like Sunshine, Franklin, and Champion. These homes are built to state code and placed on permanent foundations, making them comparable to traditional site-built homes in quality, financing, and long-term value.

What does my credit score have to be?
We work with multiple lenders who specialize in manufactured home loans, including options for low or challenged credit. There’s no set minimum, many buyers qualify with scores in the 500s and up, depending on the loan type and down payment.

How much is a down payment?
Down payments vary based on your credit, the type of loan, and whether you’re using land. Some programs allow for as little as $0 down, especially if you’re using land in lieu or qualifying for a government-backed loan. Our team will help find the lowest down payment possible for your situation.

What does the price include?
Every home includes:

Delivery and setup
Air conditioning unit
Skirting
Stairs
Built to Wind Zone 3 standards (with Wind Zone 2 and 1 available upon request)
We aim to make your home truly move-in ready with no surprise costs.

Are there any warranties?
Yes, our manufacturers provide warranties on their homes. That includes warranties on the structure, major systems, and appliances that come with your home. We’ll go over all warranty coverage with you during the buying process.

What will my note be?
Monthly notes depend on your loan type, interest rate, down payment, and the home and land you’re financing. Our team can give you a quick estimate based on lender tools and help you compare options side by side.

How can I find out if I qualify?
Getting pre-qualified is easier than most people think. Just give us a call or stop in, and we’ll walk you through a quick application process with no pressure and no commitment.

Do I have to have land/how do I get land?
No, you don’t need to already have land. We offer land and home packages and can also help you find land through our available lots or trusted real estate partners. You can also use land you already own or land given to you by family.

Do you take trade-ins for a down payment?
Yes. If you already own a home or manufactured home, we may be able to use it as a trade-in to help cover your down payment or reduce your overall costs.

How long does the process take from start to finish?
If the home is in stock, the process can take as little as a few weeks after financing and site prep. Custom orders typically take 6–12 weeks plus time for delivery and setup. We’ll keep you updated every step of the way.

Do you handle permits, utilities, and setup?
Yes. We help coordinate permits, utilities, foundation work, and full home setup with trusted local contractors. We handle as much of the process as possible so you don’t have to.

Can I customize the floor plan or features?
Yes, many of our homes offer customizable options including layout changes, upgraded finishes, and exterior features. We’ll guide you through what’s available based on your chosen home and builder.

What’s the difference between manufactured and modular homes?
Manufactured homes are built to HUD code and can go on private land or in a park. Modular homes are built to state code and installed on a permanent foundation. Modulars often qualify for more financing and appraise like traditional homes.

Do you deliver homes outside of Houma?
Yes, we serve most of southeast Louisiana and beyond. Just give us a call with your location and we’ll let you know if we can deliver and set up your home there.

Can I use land that’s in my family’s name?
Yes. If your family owns land, you may be able to use it in place of a cash down payment. We’ll help you with the paperwork to make sure it qualifies with the lender.

Do you help with insurance or homeowner setup?
Yes. We have a insurance agent on staff who specializes in manufactured and modular homes. We also help make sure all utilities and setup tasks are coordinated before move-in.
